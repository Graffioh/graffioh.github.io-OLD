I had to create an iOS App within one month, collaborating with five individuals from diverse professional backgrounds. 

The main focus was to develop an app to facilitate networking among lawyers. The key feature was an 'Assignment board,' where lawyers could post their assignments, receive and send assignment requests. 

As for my role, I had to build the back-end from scratch, which was a new experience for me since all my previous projects were offline. I won't go too in-depth as it is a private project that might be published in the future.

So my initial questions were: "Where do I start? What technologies should I use?". I've used C++ for personal projects and PostgreSQL/Java for an (offline) university project, so I had only a vague idea that a DB needs to be deployed online otherwise it would be another offline project :')

Prior to this app I used Firebase for a chat app made in 1 week, it was pretty easy and straightforward with the well written documentation and everything from the back-end already set-up.

Yeah now you are saying: "Well you have only 1 month, you can go with something already built and stable like Firebase, but also Realm or Cloudkit could be good." and guess what I did....Let's learn [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)!

After some research I understood that Express.js is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) framework and that's a runtime environment for javascript used to run the code like we were using C++, with this we can create a server that act like a bridge between the database and the app.

In 2 days I got all the basic (really really basic) theoretical knowledge about: What is a CRUD app, What is a REST API, Info about Network protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, UDP..) and so on. Now it's time to get started!

During my research on Express.js/MongoDB, I stumbled across this gem: [The Net Ninja playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jBcybHMTIia56aV21o2cZ8). Pure gold to build a fast and easy base for our server with also basic MongoDB queries. Additional resources were also: [Coding garden speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo), official documentations and a lot of stack overflow.

After the base, the front-end has been connected with the back-end part using Swift API calls, easy peasy lemon squeezy, aaaaand everything was working fine on my machine....*yes, on my machine*.

It's time for new beautiful questions:"Where do I deploy the server? Where do I deploy the database?"

The first answer was [Render.com](https://render.com/) and the second was [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) (both free tiers, for testing purpose they are fine, but in future it could be better to put the server on cloudflare workers or similar)

Overall it was a very linear experience, there were some spikes when building advanced queries with MongoDB but it's been a good journey. Of course I didn't build the most scalable solution due to my lack of experience, but it worked, so for now I'm satisfied but also not satisfied. 

In the recent version we also built a Log-In mechanism integrated with Apple Login!

I'm always open to learn new things and to re-invent myself as a software engineer and computer scientist, the curiosity and the willpower is fundamental in our field, the ones that will lack those, are going to fail.

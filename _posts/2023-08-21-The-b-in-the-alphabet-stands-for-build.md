## What's "building"?

> "The action of "building" refers to the process of creating, constructing, or assembling a physical or conceptual entity by combining various components, materials, or elements in a deliberate and organized manner. This process involves planning, designing, and executing the necessary steps to bring the desired structure, object, system, or concept into existence. Building can encompass a wide range of activities, from constructing physical structures like buildings, bridges, and machinery to creating digital products, relationships, or abstract ideas through careful arrangement and coordination of parts or elements." \
\- gpt3.5

From the beginning of time until now, humanity has consistently been engaged in the act of building, from physical building to digital building.

As engineers we have the power in our hands. We are wizards, we could create anything from 0 and that could be or not be a big leap for humanity. We will never know if we don't **start building**.

## The tools are not relevant.

No one will care which tools do you use.

Did big part of humanity really care about the nitty-gritty details of how the Web, Linux, ffmpeg, Modern LLMs or the iPhone came into existence and the specific tools used? Probably not. What truly matters is the end result, and now we're lucky to have these innovations at our fingertips. The creators simply dived in and started building.

I was a competitive FPS player and even there, we were split in two categories: 

1) Those who focused on understanding the game deeply.

2) Those who cared about mouse, keyboards, in-game sensitivity, crosshair and the entire setup.

Naturally, the majority of professional players fell into the first category, while in the second category there were some talented and hard working players who managed to go pro, but around 90% of them fell short because they prioritized the wrong elements.

I was among the 90% of the second category.

I won't repeat that same mistake. I won't get caught up in choosing an editor, a specific Linux distro, or a shiny new programming language. Instead, i'll just build and ship, to learn, iterate, and improve.

## Let's build the future together.

Personally, I'm uncertain about which product holds the potential to create a significant leap for humanity; it might be AGI or something like superconductors (rip LK-99). The essential aspect is to dream big and be optimists. ([really good related video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o48X3_XQ9to))

Lately, i've been following the e/acc scene on X, yeah they are mostly "shitpoasters" but they are also highly skilled individuals with the ability to bring impactful change in our world. I've been inspired by them to make this little post.

I wanted to share my thoughts and maybe inspire others to **build, ship and shape the future**.

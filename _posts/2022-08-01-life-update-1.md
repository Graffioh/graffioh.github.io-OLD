So, here we are again, from now on there will be a little shift regarding this blog's topic.

I got into a sort of Internship in Apple, precisely a 9 months "training program" called [Apple Developer Academy](https://www.developeracademy.unina.it/it/) in collaboration with my University.
The Academy is based on mobile development (code+design) in a team environment, really different from what you do in Uni, so I decided to apply and after some selection I got accepted with other 220 people. 

This has been an hard choice, because I needed to choose between full time uni or this sort of internship+uni. Of course the first choice would have been less stressful, as I already said, I always choose the hard and rewardful path and this is how I got in this situation.

Based on what I said, In this period I will not continue to use my free-time on reversing unfortunately because now my priorities have been shifted. 
I can try to keep this blog updated with little sort of life/what I've been learning update every month, but who knows.

See you guys. \*shake the hand\*

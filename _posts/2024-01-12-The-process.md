## "The process"
> A process is a series of steps or actions that are taken in order to achieve a particular result or goal 

Seems easy, right? Mmmm, not really. It depends on the result that needs to be achieved. Keep that in mind, but also remember that all goals can be achieved.

Why am I talking about process in general? A "process", based on that definition is something that *<u>for sure</u>* will make you achieve a goal, right? Well, it depends, I will explain why by talking about my experience with "the process".

## My experience
I first encountered this word when I was at the Apple Developer Academy. They always emphasized the importance of it, saying almost on every occasion: “trust the process”.
At first, I didn’t give much meaning to this phrase, but as time passed, it started to make more sense.
It’s not a straightforward discovery; you will understand it at the right time. For me, it was when I realized that I could learn anything by trusting the process and **doing the work**.

Why is **doing the work** in bold? Because “trust the process” doesn’t mean “just wait and you will achieve whatever you want”. Instead, it means “work hard and you will almost certainly achieve whatever you want” (at least based on my interpretation). Now, it’s my mantra.

Do I need to learn a new programming concept? A new programming language? A new math concept (hardcore challenge)? No problem. I’ll put in the work and trust the process. But why am I so sure and confident? Because I’ve experimented with it and found that it works...almost certainly.

Twitter post made some weeks ago related to that:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr" data-theme="dark">still can’t realize how much i improved during this year, unbelievable.</p>&mdash; bertø (@graffioh) <a href="https://twitter.com/graffioh/status/1738992218797486248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I just flowed through the process and now I am much better than before. A little reminder, always compare yourself to your past self.

I have almost reached my token limit, so let's close this post with something motivational

## Trust the process even if "it works...almost certainly"

Of course, there’s always a little probability that it won’t work, but we like risks, right? Otherwise, it’s useless to aim for great things.

What could go wrong even if you are *“trusting the process”*? Maybe you are not working hard enough, maybe you have trouble in your personal life, maybe the goal has changed…A lot of things could happen, so this is the little probability of failure that I am talking about.

If you have something great to aim for, don't trash it because your sorrounding say it so, instead you need to be motivated by it, you need to prove them wrong, but most importantly prove **yourself** wrong.

Now back to studying for DSA exam, cya.
